<div class="vertical_line"></div>

<p> I'll be making this website from the ground up, completely from scratch using html, css, javascript, &#60insert all the buzz words here&#62. I'll be trying to use this website as a way to motivate myself to keep up with the side projects I want to pursue and the interests that I have. I'll be posting my opinions on certain topics that I find interesting. </p>
